## Welcome in our project !
```
Welcome on ToDoList, the best way to manage your ToDoList !
```

### Project setup
```
In order to run our project, please make sure to follow these instructions :
    -Firstly, open our sql file called script_sql_todolist_CHENU_DELRIEU_ZEGHDOUD_DUMAS and make sure
    to execute it in a sql environment, such as MYSQL workbench
    -Then you should go to our two folders api and front in order to run the servers.
```

### How can we run the servers?
```
For the frontend server 
    -You should navigate into the front folder by writing the command "cd ./front" (on windows). Then, you should 
    install all the required dependencies by writing the command "npm install". Finally
    you should write "npm run serve" in a terminal to run the server.

For the backend server
    -You should navigate into the API folder by writing the command "cd ./api" (on windows).
    Make sure to have all the required libraries by writing "npm install" (
        Furthermore you should install joi and bcrypt-nodejs by witring the command 
    "npm install --save joi bcrypt-nodejs"). Then, in order to run the server, make sure to navigate
    into the src folder by writing the command "cd ./src" from the api folder. Then, write one of these two command :
    "nodemon to-do-list" or "node to-do-list".
```
